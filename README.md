1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements.
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their game Draw It or Lose It so it could run on more platforms, not just Android. They needed a design that would work well across different systems and be easy to update and manage.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I explained the design clearly and organized it in a way that made it easy to follow. I included key parts like system structure, platform choice, and design patterns.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
It helped me plan before coding. I could see how the parts would work together and avoid problems later. It made building the software easier.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the part about security and error handling. I would add more detail on how to protect data and handle mistakes in the system.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I focused on making the game work on different platforms, which the client asked for. Meeting user needs is important because the software must work for the people using it.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used diagrams, design patterns, and compared platforms. Next time, I would also ask for feedback early and test the design before starting to code.
